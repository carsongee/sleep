# Sleep

So you need a sleep Docker image?
* Need it to sleep forever?
* Need it to be updated everyday?
* Need it to work for every CPU arch?

You found it, and it's even in multiple registries!

https://hub.docker.com/r/carsongee/sleep/tags

carsongee/sleep:latest

ghcr.io/carsongee/sleep:latest

It tags each day with a date code if you want to pin, i.e., `carsongee/sleep:2025-05-07`

If you want a specific arch like armv7 or arm64, it produces those tags as well such as

`carsongee/sleep:arm64`

or

`carsongee/sleep:amd64`

or

`carsongee/sleep:arm-v6-2025-05-07`

as date tags are also added
